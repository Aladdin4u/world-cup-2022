## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React + Vite

## Optimizations

One of the first thing I would optimize is the UX for more flexibility on the app, adding stats to give detail information about matches played, Updating the score of live matches with bot automatically

## Lessons Learned:

Utilized callback functions in the server to try and build a modular and scalable API. Through this I learned , how to effectively simplify API routes into independent functions

## Installation:

1. run `npm start` // start server
